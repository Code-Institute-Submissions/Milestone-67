### Fonts

I had originally planned on using [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora?preview.text_type=custom) for the 
headings, however, I recieved some feedback from a couple of friends that something more like Roboto Mono might look better.
After testing out a couple of other fonts I decided that my friends were right so I decided to use [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono?preview.text_type=custom) for all the 
headings throughout the site with a font weight of 600 to make them stand out
slightly more than the rest of the text. I used [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=rob) for the paragraghs of the website.

### Colours

- The colours that I used for this website are orange(#ff6600), a lighter (#f8b278), grey(#5b5b61), a light grey (#c5c5c5) and white(#fff). The dark grey is used for the footer while the light 
grey is used for the backgound of the form section. For the font in the navbar I chose to use the light orange (#f8b278) as 
I felt it worked well with the grey of the hero image. For the buttons I used the darker orange (#ff6600) as I feel 
that it is a nice warm colour that works well with the other colours used for the website. The background of the website is white.

### Icons
- The icons that I used in this project were provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). I decided to use icons as they offer a pleasant visual aide to the site, 
also users tend to know that icons usually work as buttons.

#### Changes to Original Wireframes

1. In the original wireframes I had planned on having a search bar in the center of the hero image for the user to 
search for a place in Vietnam, however, as there are currently only three cities to chosoe from this seemed unnecessary. 
I decided to replace this feature with a brief description about the website and a button that brought the user to the 
section of the website where they could pick a city.

2. As there are only three cities to choose from I decided the remove the horizontal scrolling feature.

3. I decided to not add in a picture at the start of each cities section. I have plans to add a 
gallery at a later stage to provide users with images of each place.

4. I decided to move the map to in-between the options section ("Bars", "Cafes" etc) and the "Out Top3 Picks" section 
as I felt that it was better to have the map closer to the options section so that the user would not have to keep 
scrolling up to pick a different option.

5. I decided to only have three different choices for "Our Top 3 Picks" instead of four as I felt it looked better.

6. I placed the social icons on top of the copyright info in the center of the footer due to feedback I recieved 
from a couple of people that tested my website for me.

## <a name="testing">Testing</a>

---

1. I passed index.html through the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) and the first results which contained some errors 
can be seen [here](https://github.com/farrelleoin93/Milestone-2/blob/master/assets/docs/html-validator-1.png) and [here](https://github.com/farrelleoin93/Milestone-2/blob/master/assets/docs/html-validator-2.png).
After I fixed the issues I passed index.html through validation service again and no errors or warnings appeared as can be seen [here](https://github.com/farrelleoin93/Milestone-2/blob/master/assets/docs/html-validator-3.png).

2. I passed style.css through the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) and the results came back stating that there were no errors as can be seen [here-no link]

#### Manual Testing 
- All navigation bar links were clicked and verified that they brought you to the correct part of the website.
- The "Pick a City" button was clicked and it was verified that the it brought you to the "Cities" section.
- Each of the different city cards were clicked and it was verified that the correct city section appeared on the page 
while also hiding the unclicked cities.
- On each city section the different choices icons were clicked (bars, cafes etc) and verified that for the relevant 
loctions appeared on the map.
- When a different one if the choices icons was clicked the previous markers disappeared and were replaced by new markers 
at the relevant locations.
- Each marker was clicked and it was confirmed that an info window appeared displaying the name of the establishment. 
It was also confirmed that when another marker was clicked the info window on the previously clicked marker disappeared.
- Each of the "Show on map" buttons in the various "Our Top 3 Picks" sections were clicked and verified that 
the page redirected to the map and the location of the relevant location was positioned at the center of the map. It 
was also confirmed that the map zoomed in closer on the marker.
- The "Contact Us" form was filled out and it was confirmed that the paragraph displaying a confirmation message appeared 
briefly before disappearing again. 
- I then tried to send the form while have having one of the fields empty to confirm that the user was prompted 
with a message to fill in the field. This was repeated to check that it was the same for the "Name", "Email" and "Message" fields.
- Each of the social links icons were clicked and it was verified that another tab opened on the relevant website.
- The website was tested in tablet format to make sure that the information on the hero image was positioned in 
the center of the screen and that the choices icon (bars, cafes etc) were now positioned with the first three 
icons above the second two icons. All worked as expected.
- The website was then tested on the following mobile phone devices: iPhone 7/8/X, Samsung Galaxy s10/s20, 
Huawei p20/p30/p30 pro. This was to make sure that along with the changes that were made to the website in tablet 
format the three city cards and all the "Our Top 3 Picks" cards were placed one on the top of the other. 
Also the form widened to take up almost the full width of the viewport. This all worked as expected.


#### Testing User Stories

1. *As a user, I want to understand what the site is for.* - This is achieved by the paragragh on the hero image which gives a brief description of the site. 
The name *Discover Vietnam* also gives the user a hint about what kind of website it is.

2. *As a user, I want to be able to easily navigate through the site even on my first visit.* - I feel that this is achieved by a clear and 
descriptive nav bar which brings the user to the desired part of the website. 

3. *As a user, I want to be able to find interesting places to visit.* This is achieved by the website providing useful information about three different
 cities in Vietnam. The website also shows the user different places for them to visit in each city.

4. *As a user, I want to be able to easily find things to do and places to eat in each place.* - This is achieved by providing a working google maps section 
which shows markers for different types of places in each city e.g "Bars", "Cafes" etc. The website also provides a "Top 3 Picks" 
section which gives the a brief descriptions of three different places in each city.

5. *As a user, I want to be able to see useful information about flights to the places in the features on the website or else information about weather in these places.* - 
The website does not currently provide the useer with this feature, however, this feature will be added to the website iin the future.

6. *As a user, I want to be able to see where all the places mentioned on the website are.* - This is achieved by markers appearing on the map showing the location of all 
the different places in each city that the user might want to visit.

7. *As a user, I want to be able to easily contact the owner of the website.* - This is achieved by the working form located at the end of the website. The 
user is also provided with a link to this section of the website in the navbar.


## <a name="bugs">Bugs</a>

---

### Bugs fixed while building the website:

1. The button on the "Our Top 3 Picks" cards was not centered on tablet and mobile devices.
   - This was fixed by applying the code that I found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8508275/how-to-center-a-position-absolute-element). This made sure 
  the button was always centered on the card. 

2. The markers were only appearing on the Hanoi map as I originally had three seperate maps.
   - This was fixed by only having one map that the center was changed when a different city was clicked, this 
   resulted in the markers appearing for locations in each city. It also makes it easier to add more cities in the future.

3. The markers on the map were not clearing when another option or place was clicked.
   - This bug was fixed by using the code found [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/marker-remove) 
   for the clear markers function. 

4. Most of the images were not appearing in the live version of the website.
   - This was fixed by simply adding "." to the start of the path to the image.
