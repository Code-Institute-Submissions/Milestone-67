### Fonts

For this website I have decided to use [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora?query=lor) for all the headings throughout the site with a font weight of 600 to make them stand out
slightly more than the rest of the text. I used [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=rob) for the paragraghs of the website.

### Colours

- The colours that I used for this website are Orange(#ff6600) and White(#fff). The Orange is used for the header and footer as well as for some bouttons and cards thoughout the website.
I choose these colours as I felt that the orange was warm and inviting and I felt that the white was a nice contrast to the orange.
