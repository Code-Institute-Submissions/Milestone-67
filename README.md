## <a name="design-choices">Design Choices</a>

---

### Fonts

For this website I have decided to use [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora?query=lor) for all the headings throughout the site with a font weight of 600 to make them stand out
slightly more than the rest of the text. I used [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=rob) for the paragraghs of the website.

### Colours

- The colours that I used for this website are grey(#5b5b61), orange(#ff6600), green(#00cc00) and white(#fff). The grey is used for the header and footer.
For the buttons I used orange as I feel that it is a nice warm colour that works well with the grey of the header and footer. I decided that the colour 
of the forms button should change to green when the email successfully sends, this is to make it clear to the user that their email actually sent. 
The background of the website is white as I feel that it is a nice clean colour that works well with the other colours used in the website.

### Icons
- The icons that I used in this project were provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/). I decided to use fonts as they offer a pleasant visual aide to the site, 
also users tend to know that icons usually work as buttons.

## <a name="testing">Testing</a>

---

1. I passed index.html through the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) and the first results which contained some errors 
can be seen [here](https://github.com/farrelleoin93/Milestone-2/blob/master/assets/docs/html-validator-1.png) and [here](https://github.com/farrelleoin93/Milestone-2/blob/master/assets/docs/html-validator-2.png).
After I fixed the issues I passed index.html through validation service again and no errors or warnings appeared as can be seen [here](https://github.com/farrelleoin93/Milestone-2/blob/master/assets/docs/html-validator-3.png).

2. I passed style.css through the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) and the results came back stating that there were no errors as can be seen [here-no link]

#### Testing User Stories

1. *As a user, I want to understand what the site is for.* - This is achieved by the paragragh on the hero image which gives a brief description of the site. 
The name *Discover Vietnam* also gives the user a hint about what kind of website it is.

2. *As a user, I want to be able to easily navigate through the site even on my first visit.* - I feel that this is achieved by a clear and 
descriptive nav bar which brings the user to the desired part of the website. 

3. *As a user, I want to be able to find interesting places to visit.* This is achieved by the website providing useful information about three different
 cities in Vietnam. The website also shows the user different places for them to visit in each city.

4. *As a user, I want to be able to easily find things to do and places to eat in each place.* - This is achieved by providing a working google maps section 
which shows markers for different types of places in each city e.g "Bars", "Cafes" etc. The website also provides a "Top 3 Picks" 
section which gives the a brief descriptions of three different places in each city.

5. *As a user, I want to be able to see useful information about flights to the places in the features on the website or else information about weather in these places.* - 
The website does not currently provide the useer with this feature, however, this feature will be added to the website iin the future.

6. *As a user, I want to be able to see where all the places mentioned on the website are.* - This is achieved by markers appearing on the map showing the location of all 
the different places in each city that the user might want to visit.

7. *As a user, I want to be able to easily contact the owner of the website.* - This is achieved by the working form located at the end of the website. The 
user is also provided with a link to this section of the website in the navbar.


## <a name="bugs">Bugs</a>

### Bugs fixed while building the website:

1. The button on the "Our Top 3 Picks" cards was not centered on tablet and mobile devices.
  - This was fixed by applying the code that I found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8508275/how-to-center-a-position-absolute-element). This made sure 
  the button was always centered on the card. 

2. The markers on the map were not clearing when another option or place was clicked.
  - This bug was fixed by using the code found [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/marker-remove) for the clear markers function. 

## <a name="deployment">Deployment</a>

To deploy this project from its GitHub repository to GitHub Pages the following steps were taken:
1. From the projects repository I clicked on **Settings**.
